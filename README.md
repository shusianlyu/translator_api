# translator_api

This project implements a Flask-based REST API that serves as a dictionary. It allows users to retrieve the definition of a word by making a GET request to the appropriate endpoint. The API utilizes a CSV file, dictionary.csv, which contains a collection of words and their corresponding definitions.
